My goal is to build user-centric applications by leveraging 10+ years of experience supporting customers with software and hardware as well as my recently developed computer programming skills.

With experience working with software and hardware in customer-focused roles in the audiovisual, legal and financial industries, I combine technical aptitude and analytical/problem-solving skills with a leadership style built on positive human communication.

I discovered the power and flexibility of computer programming by seeing it firsthand during the integration of complex AV systems. Wanting to work directly with source code, I began learning C# and the fundamentals of object-oriented programming in the Code Kentucky Software Development track. I seek to use these skills to develop multi-tier scalable, performant, and reliable user-centric applications.
